This repository consists of codes (in Yabasic) and the final report for AAM40A Academic Exercise: Mathematics. 

In this project, we explored algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) in the task of image classification. 
In particular, we analyzed, mathematically, how each of the algorithm performs the classification. 

The codes for each of the algorithms can be found within their corresponding folders. The report is in the \texttt{main} branch.
